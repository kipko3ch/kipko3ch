ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Kipkoech!
I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for crafting seamless web experiences. On the front end, I rock React, Next.js, HTML/CSS, and TypeScript. On the back end, I work with Neon DB, Supabase, and I'm currently diving deeper into Python for more powerful server-side development (with C on the horizon!).

Always curious, always coding. Letâ€™s build something awesome together!

Twende kazi!
